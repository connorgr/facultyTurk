    <ul>
      <li>Name</li>
      <li>Their homepage/website URL</li>
      <li>Type of professor</li>
      <li>Where they got their PhD from</li>
      <li>If it is listed, what their research area is.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Your submission will be verified as to whether or not it lists all relevant faculty and the correctness of your responses.</strong></p>

<p>You will be shown the instructions again once you start the task on the following page</p>
